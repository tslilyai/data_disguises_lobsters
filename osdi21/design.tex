\sys~relies on coarse-grained schema annotations to establish which associations to decorrelate, and
builds a dataflow computation resulting in materialized views that answer application queries. Use
of dataflow automatically propagates the correct updates to materialized views.

\sys~resubscribes
users by transparently propagating updates to materialized views to expose real user identifiers in
place of ghost identifiers.
