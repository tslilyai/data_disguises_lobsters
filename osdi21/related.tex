Companies have developed frameworks to avoid deletion bugs (e.g., DELF~\cite{delf} at Facebook), but many
applications decorrelate only coarsely by associating remnants of data with a global placeholder for
all deleted users, or do not decorrelate at all (e.g., replacing usernames with a pseudonym).
