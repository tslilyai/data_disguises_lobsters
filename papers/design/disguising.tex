\section{Disguise Application and Reversal}

Table~\ref{tab:funcs} describe \sys's internal functions run server-side to implement its API 
and apply or reverse disguises. 

Figures~\ref{fig:appdisg} and \ref{fig:revdisg} describe how \sys implements disguise application and
reversal respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:opexec} describes how disguise operations update application
state and produce and modify tokens, and 
Figure~\ref{fig:revtoken} describes how \sys uses a token's recorded
modification to reverse an applied disguise operation. 
Figure~\ref{fig:rpt} describes how \sys accesses the private tokens
corresponding to disguise $d$ and principal $p$ by recursively decrypting tokens and traversing
\tokls{pd}.

\sys's implementations of the remaining functions in Table~\ref{tab:funcs} simply read or write into
persistent maps indexed by principal and/or disguise.

\subsection{Composing Disguise Applications and Reversals}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Some Notation.}}
We describe disguise histories as a list of \app{d} and \rev{d} actions, where \app{d} corresponds
to the application of disguise $d$, and \rev{d} corresponds to the reversal of $d$. Time moves to
the right in the list.

For every data object $O$ in the system, \ostart describes its initial state, and
\ohist{[\app{d_1}, \dots]} describes its state after \sys has applied the history [\app{d_1},
$\dots$].

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Multiple Disguise Applications.}}
Let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be two disguises, where $d_1$ is applied after $d_2$.
to produce disguise history [\app{d_1}, \app{d_2}]. 
%
Let $O$ be some data object in the system, where \ostart is its initial state, and
\ohist{[\app{d_1}, \app{d_2}]} be the final state after \sys applies $d_1$ and $d_2$.
%
If both $d_1$ and $d_2$ update $O$, what is \ohist{[\app{d_1}, \app{d_2}]}?
We consider two possible end states: 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item[($S_1$)] \ohist{[\app{d_1}, \app{d_2}]} reflects the application of $d_1$ \textbf{and} $d_2$ to \ostart. In other
words, at least one of the \op{d_2}s' predicates \texttt{pred} matches \ostart, and thus \op{d_2} is
applied to \ohist[\app{d_1}] even if \texttt{pred} does not match \ohist[\app{d_1}]. 
\op{d_2} updates are applied on top of any $d_1$'s' updates if the two conflict.

\item[($S_2$] \ohist{[\app{d_1}, \app{d_2}]} reflects the application of $d_1$ to \ostart, followed
by the application of $d_2$ to \ohist{[\app{d_1}]}. \op{d_2} predicates match only against
\ohist{[\app{d_1}]}, and are not aware of the original state \ostart.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
For example, let \op{d_1} decorrelate all posts from authors predicated
on \texttt{author = Bea}, and let \op{d_2} remove all posts predicated on \texttt{author = Bea}.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item[($S_1$)] Both \op{d_1} and \op{d_2} update posts originally having author ``Bea'', resulting in the
removal of all posts originally with author Bea.

\item[($S_2$)] Applying \op{d_1} results in all posts with author ``Bea'' having
pseudoprinicipal authors such as ``anonFox.'' \op{d_2} only knows the state of posts after
\op{d_1} occurs, and does not remove any posts because no post has author ``Bea''.
\end{enumerate}

The choice of whether \ohist{[\app{d_1}, \app{d_2}]} should result in $S_1$ or $S_2$ depends on the
specific application and is left to the developer to specify. 

However, only $S_2$ may be possible in certain scenarios.
In order to achieve $S_1$, $d_2$ must evalute predicates against \ostart, and therefore must know
how $d_1$ modified $O$ (\eg knowing that a post with author ``anonFox'' originally was a post with
author ``Bea'').  This information, however, is stored in tokens produced by $d_1$. 

These tokens may be inaccessible \sys when applying $d_2$, as they could be stored privately for
principal $q$: a client who invokes $d_2$ while either unauthenticated, or authenticated as
principal $p \neq q$, cannot access $q$'s tokens for $d_1$. 
In this case, $d_2$ can only match against \ohist{[\app{d_1}]} and achieve $S_2$.
This is shown in Table~\ref{tab:composeapp}.

\subsection{Using Disguise History to Delay Disguise Actions}

\noindent\textbf{\emph{Delayed Disguise Application.}}
A disguise $d_2$ may be retroactively applied to a data object $O$ revealed during reversal of
disguise $d_1$.  This occurs when $d_2$ applies to the original $O$, but not the $d_1$-disguised
$O$, and $d_1$'s tokens are inaccessible to \sys when applying $d_2$.

\sys uses the disguise history to know when to retroactively apply the
disguise when the data is revealed.  Disguising prior to restoration should be deterministic (based
on contents of data in application database, and e.g., not predicated on the current time).

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Delayed Disguise Reversal.}}
In certain scenarios, \sys may not completely reverse a disguise $d_1$ if future disguise $d_2$
modifies the same data as $d_1$. If $d_2$ has applied a more recent, conflicting update to data
objects disguised by $d_1$, then the original data contents prior to $d_1$ cannot be restored. 

\sys logs the reversal of $d_1$ in the disguise history, and uses this history to detect if it
should reverse any conflicting updates performed by $d_1$ when $d_2$ is reversed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Token Migration and Modification}
Let $d_1$ be a global disguise and $d_2$ be a private disguise applied in sequence.

Consider the scenario in which \op{d_1} updates (decorrelates, modifies, or removes) a data object
$O$, producing a global token \tdata{pd_1}. Later, \sys determines that \op{d_2} would have applied to the
removed $O$ by checking if the corresponding \op{d_2} predicate matches recorded object data stored in \tdata{pd_1}.

\sys updates \tdata{pd_1} with \op{d_2}'s update in order to not leak information about $O$ that $d_2$ should disguise. An update to a token such as \tdata{pd_1} itself generates a (private) token \tdata{pd_2}, just as updating a data object generates a token. Reversing $d_2$ uses this \tdata{pd_2} to reverse the modification to \tdata{pd_1}. If $d_1$ has
already been reversed and the state of $O$ in the database has been updated to reflect the contents of \tdata{pd_1},
then \sys simply uses \tdata{dp_2} to reverse the current state of $O$ in the database. 

\lyt{Note that removal is just an interesting case of this, in which \tdata{pd_1} is removed, by a
token \tdata{pd_2} is stored in \tokls{pd_2} that saves the removal of \tdata{pd_1} for reversal.}

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Token Modification for Object Identification.}}
Tokens need to refer to the correct objects even if objects have been modified by future disguises.
Prior tokens should be revised by future disguises so that they apply correctly to the disguised
data.
This allows an earlier disguise to be reversed correctly.
An easy way to avoid needing to do this is to have all objects in the DB have unique, permanent
identifiers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Handling Interleaved Application Updates}
\noindent\textbf{\emph{Application Updates to Present Disguised Data.}}
\sys will not reveal disguised data still present in the database that has been updated by the
application. Application updates are equivalent to irreversible disguise operations.
\sys checks the current state of data against the latest disguised state
expected as recorded in the token; if they do not match, then an application update has occurred
since disguising, and \sys will not alter the data.

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Application Updates to Removed Disguised Data.}}
Application updates fail to update data removed by a disguise, which can later be revealed in
original form.
\sys requires all application updates that must immediately apply to revealed data (that is
currently disguised and removed) to be disguises themselves; otherwise, the application must handle
the possibility of non-updated data being revealed.
%\sys stores a query log of all application update queries, and reapplies them to any removed data by a disguise prior to revealing the data
