\section{Overview}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In normal database-backed applications, the application database contents completely capture data
held by the system. The application acts as the sole creator and updater of database contents. 

We target applications that have \emph{principals} (\ie user accounts in a \texttt{users} table) as
first-class citizens; each principal $p$ owns some data objects in the database (\eg a row in an
\texttt{address} table), and is created by some external user \user{p}.
%
This is typical of social network sites such as Facebook or Reddit; and other web applications that
tie functionality to user accounts (\eg ecommerce or bank applications).

Our design considers \emph{disguisable application systems}, which consist of a typical database-backed
application and a disguising tool (\sys) operating alongside the application. This system operates
on three types of data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{\textbf{Database Contents}}: The application reads and modifies database
        contents, which include visible, undisguised and currently-disguised daa.
        \sys modifies the data database contents when it applies and reveals disguises.
    \item \emph{\textbf{Disguise History}}: Data about which disguises \sys has applied or
        reversed, used for revealing and to compose disguises on top of one another.
    \item \emph{\textbf{Disguise Tokens}}: Application-inaccessible data that \sys's disguise application.
        Tokens encode information about disguise modifications to database contents, and \sys uses
        them to compose disguises on top of one another or to reveal a disguise.
\end{enumerate}
\ms{Edited above for passive voice and to add clarity about database contents.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Security Goals}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We assume an attacker who, after compromising the system, can perform any actions the
application or \sys can perform, and access any data the application or \sys can access.

\sys itself is honest but curious: when applying or reversing a disguise, \sys may temporarily
hold (in memory) plaintext token data, as well as private or symmetric keys, but is trusted to
forget them once the disguise action is complete. 
Finally, we assume standard security of public key and symmetric key primitives.

With this threat model, our goals are three-fold: 

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{(1) Security of Restricted Disguise Application.}}
We support disguises that optionally require authentication as a principal $p$ prior to being
applied (or reversed). If so, only a client authenticated for principal $p$ can apply (and reverse) this disguise (and an
attacker unauthenticated as $p$ cannot).

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{(2) Security of Private Disguise Tokens.} }
Tokens are optionally private to a single principal $p$, such that only \user{p} can authorize
access to these tokens. An attacker who is not this \user{p} cannot
authorize or access private disguise tokens created prior to compromise, even if authenticated as $p$.\ms{Don't understand this; seems self-contradictory?
If \user{p} is authenticated as $p$, they surely speak-for $p$ and can access its data?}

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{(3) Security of Private Disguise Token Metadata.}}
An attacker cannot learn how many private disguise tokens created prior to compromise are associated with a principal $p$'s data.

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Non-Goals.}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Security of private tokens or restricted disguises when an attacker has prior snapshots of system data.
    \item Security of restricted disguise application if an attacker authenticates as the principal.
    \item Security of $p$'s private tokens and token metadata if \user{p} authorizes access to these
        tokens, or if an attacker compromises \user{p}.\ms{See above; is there some subtle difference between \user{p} and $p$ that I'm missing?}
    \item Unlinkability via unmodified data contents after disguising. A disguise may leave explicit correlations
        between pieces of data and a principal (e.g., a comment that mentions the authorâ€™s name) as part
        of database contents that the disguise leaves alone.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strawman: Open Setting}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the \emph{open setting}, no type of data is kept hidden from \sys. In particular, the different data
types have the following access policies and affect each category of data as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c c c}
        \textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{\sys Access} & \textbf{\user{p} Access}\\
\hline
        Database Contents & Yes & Yes \\
        Disguise History & Yes & Yes \\
        Disguise Tokens & Yes & Yes \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Access to different data types in the open setting.}
\label{tab:accopen}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{ p{0.2\linewidth} p{.8\linewidth}}
        \textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Disguise Effect}\\
\hline
        Database Contents & \sys modifies database contents, converting database rows to disguised
        versions according to the disguise specification (decorrelating, modifying, or removing the
        rows).        
        \\
        Disguise History & \sys appends a record of the disguise action (disguise ID + whether
        applied or reversed) to the history.\\
        Disguise Tokens & \sys saves a set of tokens to remember what modifications each disguise
        operation performed. \\
\end{tabular}
