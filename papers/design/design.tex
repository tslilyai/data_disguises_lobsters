\section{Threat Model}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An adversary can access any data stored as plaintext by the application or \sys, including data not
exposed via its client-facing API. We assume that an adversary cannot access prior snapshots of the
application database, or observe modifications or memory accesses performed during disguise
application. Furthermore, undisguised content and implicit correlations based on this content (e.g.,
a comment that mentions the authorâ€™s name) are out of scope.

We assume \sys is honest but curious: when applying or reversing a disguise, \sys may temporarily
hold (in memory) plaintext token data, as well as private or symmetric keys, but is trusted to
forget them once the disguise action is complete.  

Finally, we assume standard security of public key and symmetric key primitives~\note{under a random
oracle model?}.
