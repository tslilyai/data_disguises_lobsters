\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{API Calls.}}
Table~\ref{tab:api} describes all the API calls used in protocols between \sys and a client.

Figure~\ref{fig:acctreg} illustrates the principal registration protocol: every principal in the
system must register a public key with \sys in order to later reveal (for disguise reversal or
composition) any of privately disguised data. \sys remembers each public key \pubk{p} along with
$p$'s ID.

Figures~\ref{fig:authdisapp} and \ref{fig:unauthdisapp} illustrate the protocols for authenticated
and unauthenticated disguise application respectively. Authenticated and unauthenticated disguise
reversal protocols follow the same logic as disguise application protocols, with the only
differences being the API call invoked by the client (\fn{StartDisguiseReversal($d$)}) and the
function that \sys calls at the end (\fn{ReverseDisguise($d$ tokens)}).

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{\sys Internal Functions.}}
Table~\ref{tab:funcs} describe \sys's internal functions run server-side to implement these
protocols and apply or reverse disguises. 

Figure~\ref{fig:rpt} describes how \sys accesses the private tokens
corresponding to disguise $d$ and principal $p$ by recursively decrypting tokens and traversing
\tokls{pd}.
Figures~\ref{fig:appdisg} and \ref{fig:revdisg} describe how \sys implements disguise application and
reversal respectively; Figure~\ref{fig:revtoken} describes how \sys uses a token's recorded
modification to reverse an applied disguise operation. 

\sys's implementations of the remaining functions in Table~\ref{tab:funcs} simply read or write into
persistent maps indexed by principal and/or disguise.

\vspace{6pt}\noindent\textbf{\emph{Note: Why would disguise reversal require tokens from prior disguises?}} 
The application of a disguise $d$ may modify the contents of prior disguise $d'$ tokens!
This can occur because some token \tdata{} may store removed data that, if in the database, would be
affected by the application of $d$. When $d$ is applied, \tdata{}'s data is updated to reflect the
modification by $d$; similarly, when $d$ is reversed, \tdata{}'s original contents are restored.

    \caption{\textbf{Authenticated disguise application.} 
The client first invokes the \fn{StartDisguise} API call, authenticated as principal $p$.  
    Prior to applying the disguise, \sys requests to access $p$'s private tokens by sending a
    \fn{RequestTokenAccess} to the client with all \symk{pd} ciphertexts for all $d$ in the disguise
    history.  \\
    The client decrypts the ciphertexts if it has $p$'s private key \privk{p} (proving
    that the client has access to $p$'s private tokens).  \\
    The client only includes the decrypted \symk{pd'} in the set of keys sent back to \sys via a
    \fn{GrantTokenAccess} API call if the client wants to authorizes access to $p$'s private tokens
    from disguise $d'$. \\
    \sys uses each \symk{pd'} to decrypt $p$'s private tokens produced by disguise $d'$. 
    \sys combines all decrypted private tokens with the set of globally accessible tokens to produce
    all tokens available for disguise composition of $d$ on top of $d'$. 
    \lyt{Note: this requires that a client be authenticated as $p$ to access $p$'s tokens, which
    isn't necessarily fundamental.}}
