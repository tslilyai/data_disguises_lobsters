Web services increasingly face legal requirements to protect
users' privacy (e.g.,\ the GDPR). These laws require companies to properly
delete and anonymize usersâ€™ data when a user requests to remove their data.
%
And beyond current legal requirements, many users would rest easier if they
knew that they can unsubscribe from a web service at any time, without losing
their data and with the opportunity to come back later.

But unsubscribing users without compromising either the leaving user's
privacy or the application experience for the remaining users is difficult.
%
Removing too much information meets privacy requirements, but may yield
surprising application behavior (e.g.,\ disappearing content); removing too
little risks exposing the identity of unsubscribed users via inference
attacks.

In this paper, we propose \sys{}, a new system for safe unsubscription and
resubscription of users in database-backed web services.
%
\sys{} helps application developers specify fine-grained privacy policies to
meet de-identification requirements, and goes beyond: with \sys{}, it is
possible for users to switch between a privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode
and an identity-revealing subscribed mode at any time without permanently
losing their data.
%
This facilitates important new web service paradigms, such as users granting
a time-limited ``lease'' of data to a service instead of having a permanent
service account.
