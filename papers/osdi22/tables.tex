\fn{RegisterPrincipal($p$)} $\rightarrow$ \privk{p} & Registers $p$ as
        a principal, returning a private key \privk{p} corresponding to a principal-specific public
        key $\pubk{p}$ known to \sys.\\
    \vspace{6pt}\\
\fn{StartDisguise($d$) $\rightarrow$ ()} & Invoked to inform \sys that a disguise application is
        starting.
    \vspace{6pt}\\
        \fn{EndDisguise($d$) $\rightarrow$ (\lcapa{pd}, \lcapa{pd})} & Marks the end of applying disguise $d$.
        Returns a pair of locators required to later locate disguise $d$'s diff tokens and ownership tokens
        respectively.
    \vspace{6pt}\\
        \fn{SaveDiffToken($p$, $d$, tokenData)} $\rightarrow$ () & Securely stores tokenData in a diff token \tdiff{pd}.\\
    \vspace{6pt}\\
        \fn{SaveOwnershipToken($p$, $p'$, $d$, tokenData)} $\rightarrow$ () & Securely stores tokenData in an
        ownership token \town{pd} that saves the link from principal $p$ to pseudoprincipal $p'$.\\
    \vspace{6pt}\\
        \fn{CreatePseudoprincipal()} $\rightarrow$ ($p$, \fn{principalData}) & Returns
        the pseudoprincipal ID and data of a new pseudoprincipal. \fn{principalData} is
        generated using an application-specified pseudoprincipal-generation policy.\\

        \fn{GetTokensOfDisguise($d$, \privk{p}, \lcapa{pd})}
        $\rightarrow$ (\{\tdiff{pd}\}, \{\town{pd}\}) & Retrieves the diff and ownership tokens produced by 
        disguise $d$ that are accessible with the provided locator 
        and decryption capability.
    \vspace{6pt}\\
        \fn{GetPseudoprincipalsOf($p$, \privk{p}, \{\lcapa{pd}\})} $\rightarrow$ \{$p'$\} & Returns
        the pseudoprincipal IDs of all pseudoprincipals linked with $p$ produced by disguises $d$.
        The decryption capability and set of locators enable \sys to access ownership tokens that
        reveal links between $p$ and its pseudoprincipals.\\
