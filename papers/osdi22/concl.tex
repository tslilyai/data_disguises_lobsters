\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

%
We have described \emph{data disguising}, a new framework that improves user
data privacy in web applications by making it easy for developers to write
correct and secure privacy transformations.
%
Data disguising secures the confidentiality of inactive user's data against
a powerful attacker who compromises the server.
%
We used our prototype data disguising tool, \sys, to add new privacy
transformations to two existing web applications with small modifications.
%
\sys's disguise operations are fast and impose little overhead on normal
application operation.
%
We will release \sys as open-source software.
