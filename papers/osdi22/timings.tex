GDPR Deletion requires decrypting ownership token + selecting DB rows to remove (for both original
user and pseudoprincipals) + removing DB rows +
encrypting and inserting diff tokens for each lecture (4x).

Editing an anonymized answer current decrypts \emph{all} ownership tokens, even for lectures that
are associated with different lectures. This means that for 20 lectures, editing the answers
of a single lecture requires 20 decryptions.
