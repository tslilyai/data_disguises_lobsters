\subsection{Security: do we meet our meet security goals}
   - attack scenarios

\subsection{Performance}
   1) Normal operation: overheads imposed by Edna
    1.1) Cost of pseudoprincipals
         - Query runtime
         - Storage space
   2) Disguise operations
    2.1) Impact on concurrent users of web app
    2.2) Latency of the operations themselves

\subsection{Case studies}
   1) websubmit
      - was Edna sufficient for the application's needs?
      - changes to application required (how much work to integrate Edna?)
      - *how* did application use Edna?
        - what disguises?
        - how caps integrated with application?
   2) HotCRP
   3) Lobsters?
