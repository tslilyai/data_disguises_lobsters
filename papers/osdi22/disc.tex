\lyt{Should we note somewhere that pseudoprincipals and recursive disguising are why we need asymmetric
crypto; otherwise, we could just send the symmetric key to the original user being disguised?}

\lyt{
An alternative design might remove encrypted records completely (and \eg store them in external per-user
vaults or email them to the client).
This leaves no trace in \sys or the application, and would prevent the attacker from learning
anything. However, this places a large burden on the client.
Maybe put this in future work?

\ms{Hiding bag sizes -- very expensive, as would need to pad to max user data size, or add noise
proportional to that. Likely impractical.}
