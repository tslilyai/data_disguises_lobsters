\label{s:api}

\input{api}

\sys exposes two APIs:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
 \item A high-level API (Figure~\ref{f:api-high}) for applications that want \sys to do
   all the work of applying data disguises, including database modifications, based on
   a declarative disguise specification and a database schema with foreign key
   relationships.
 \item A low-level API (Figure~\ref{f:api-low}) that provides application developers with
   additional control. This API allows custom organization of disguised data, lets the
   application make its own database modifications, and is schema-agnostic.
\end{enumerate}
%
\sys's high-level API is internally implemented in terms of the low-level API and its
abstractions, we primarily discuss the low-level API in this paper.
%
\S\ref{s:api-high} briefly describes the high-level API.
%

\ms{I just dumped old content here; this needs reorganizing.}

%
We structure the API description around an example application, websubmit-rs~\cite{websubmit-rs}.
%
websubmit-rs is used by students at a U.S.\ university to submit homework assignments for classes.
%


\sys exposes an API (Table~\ref{tab:api}) to web applications that wish to support secure
disguising.
%
The API allows the application to start and end disguises; securely save diff and speaks-for token
data; and extract token data when necessary to enable post-disguise temporary recorrelation or
disguise revealing.
%
\sys also provides a higher-level convenience API (Table~\ref{tab:high_level_api}) that enables
applications to apply and reveal (a restricted set) of disguises without needing to implement the
disguise's application database modifications.

To use \sys's API, applications must provide \sys with a description of principal IDs and how to
generate new principal objects.

\subsection{Disguising}

We next describe how an application uses \sys's API.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Principal Registration.}
Every client who creates an application account for principal $p$ registers the principal's unique id
with \sys by invoking \fn{RegisterPrincipal}. \sys generates a public-private key pair, returning private key \privk{p} to the
application. \sys saves the public key \pubk{p} with $p$'s ID.

The application handles passing \privk{p} to the client; \privk{p} will allow the user running the
client to later access $p$'s disguise tokens.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Disguising and Disguise Tokens.}
When a client speaking for principal $p$ wants to apply a disguise $d$,
the application invokes \fn{StartDisguise} to signal \sys that a new disguise has begun.
The application then performs the disguise's data updates (\eg, removing or modifying
data objects). If the application wishes for the original data to be later revealed, the
application generates some custom diff and invokes \fn{SaveDiffToken} with the diff.

In the case that the application decorrelates a data object from a principal, the application
queries \sys for a new pseudoprincipal owner for the data object (to preserve referential integrity)
using \fn{CreatePseudoprincipal}. \sys returns the pseudoprincipal's ID and object data; the
application handles properly inserting the pseudoprincipal object.  If the application wishes for
the original owning principal to be temporarily or permanently recorrelated with the data object,
the application generates any speaks-for information it wishes to save, and invokes
\fn{SaveSpeaksForToken} with both the original principal's and new pseudoprincipal's IDs.

When the disguise is complete, the application invokes \fn{EndDisguise}. This informs \sys to erase
any sensitive data, complete any token encryption operations, and to return to the application a
pair of locators that will allow \sys later to locate the (encrypted) diff and speaks-for tokens
produced by the disguise respectively.

The application handles passing the locators \lcapa{pd} to the user speaking for $p$; to ensure that
adversaries cannot learn that disguise $d$ applied to principal $p$, the application should not
retain locators.

\subsection{Operations on Disguised Data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Disguise Revealing.}
In order to reveal the original state of data disguised by $d$ for principal $p$, the application
needs to retrieve the diff and speaks-for tokens of $p$ from $d$ storing information about the undisguised
state prior to applying $d$.
This requires the application to obtain the locators \lcapa{pd} and decryption capability \privk{p}
from a client speaking for $p$.

With these in hand, the application calls \fn{GetTokensOfDisguise}, which returns the set of
(plaintext) diff and speaks-for tokens from disguise $d$ for principal $p$; the application then uses
the token data to reveal data as appropriate.
\lyt{Add details about how sometimes we need multiple locators $d' \neq d$ because of pseudoprincipals?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Temporary Authorization.}
The application may also wish to temporarily recorrelate users with their data by temporarily
authorizing them to act on behalf of a pseudoprincipal. For example, users can temporarily act as
anonymous users to edit their anonymized lecture answers. Furthermore, applications may wish to
\emph{compose} disguises on top of anonymized data, to \eg delete now-anonymized data that
originally belonged to $p$ when $p$ deletes their account.

\sys allows the application to query for all pseudoprincipals corresponding to a particular
principal using \fn{GetPseudoprincipalsOf}, which returns the set of corresponding pseudoprincipal
IDs. The application must provide (obtaining from the client) any locators \lcapa{pd} from
anonymizing disguises $d$ that produced the pseudoprincipals in question, as well as the client's
decryption capability \privk{p}. This allows \sys to inspect the content of speaks-for tokens and
verify links between principal $p$ and pseudoprincipals stored in speaks-for tokens.

Once the application knows which pseudoprincipals $p'$ correspond to a principal $p$, the application can
authorize a client acting on behalf of $p$ to act on behalf of $p'$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Disguising and Revealing with the High-Level API.}
If an application developer does not want to implement the necessary data transformations for disguise
application and revealing, the developer can provide a disguise specification in a language provided
by \sys, which includes schema information and supports a restricted set of SQL database
modifications. When \fn{ApplyDisguise} is invoked with the disguise specification, \sys applies the
disguise data transformations and automatically generates the appropriate diff and speaks-for tokens.

Similarly, when \fn{RevealDisguise} is invoked, \sys can interpret the automatically-generated diff and
speaks-for tokens and perform the data modifications to restore the original state of data (given
that no subsequent updates had been performed since disguising).

Application handling of locators and decryption capabilities remains the same: \fn{ApplyDisguise}
takes optional locators and decryption capabilities to support disguise composition, and produces
locators for the applied disguise; \fn{RevealDisguise} takes locators and decryption capabilities to
locate and access tokens to reveal.
