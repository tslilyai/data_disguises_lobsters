\sys enables HotCRP to support the following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item\emph{1st-Party GDPR-Compliant Disguising:}
HotCRP supports user-invoked disguise(s) to modify, decorrelate and/or delete the user's data and
account, meeting the requirements of the GDPR's right to be forgotten.

    \item \emph{1st-Party Disguised Data Restoration}: HotCRP users who invoke GDPR deletion are given the
        option to return by revealing their disguise; however, between disguising and revealing
        their account, no other entity learns the identity or existence of the user (ensuring that
        the disguise complies with the GDPR).

    \item\emph{3rd-Party Disguising.}
\sys supports disguises applied by users (such as an admin) that transform data of other users in the system. For example, universal conference anonymization or
    comment removal alters data not associated with the invoking admin.

\item \emph{Data Decay}: After several years, the admin can decay identifiers in the conference data
    by decorrelating all users from their authored reviews and papers.  This helps protect reviewers
        and paper authors from being unblinded in the case of a data breach.

\item \emph{Temporary Recorrelation with Anonymized Data}:
Even after universal decorrelation, HotCRP allows users to apply GDPR account
deletion to delete even their decorrelated papers and reviews that they wrote.
%

%
Furthermore, HotCRP users can also view reviews on their papers, or edit their reviews, even if
        these papers and reviews have been decorrelated and belong to anonymous users.  HotCRP users
        interact with a personalized, temporary database view when they visit their decorrelated
        data.

Data disguising enables temporary recorrelation to support these use cases \emph{without} changing
        the database contents and revealing to other users of the system
which actual user authored these anonymized papers and reviews.

\item \emph{Further Disguising of Anonymized Users' Data}: A disguise such as universal comment
        removal can be applied after universal decorrelation, even though it now applies to data of anonymous users.
This allows disguises to be developed over time, and to remove identifying data potentially mistakenly missed by prior
disguises, but which now belongs to anonymous users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Secure Disguise Records Design}
Applications save disguise metadata in the form of records: speaks-for records \town{pd} save information linking
principals to anonymous pseudoprincipals, and diff records \tdiff{pd} save information about modifications
performed during the disguise.
We discuss here how the \sys securely stores records produced by applications upon disguising, and
how \sys allows applications to efficiently and securely retrieve these records.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Record Wrappers.}
In order to generically handle record data, \sys stores all records in record wrappers.
Wrappers store the bytes of the record \tdiff{pd} or \town{pd} (provided
by the application), a correlated principal ID $p$, and the disguise ID $d$ of the disguise producing the
record. In addition, \sys includes a random nonce in the record wrapper to prevent known plaintext
attacks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Securing Record Access.}
When a new principal $p$ is created, \sys produces a private-public keypair, and returns \privk{p} to
the application (which then sends it to the appropriate client). \sys stores \pubk{p} associated
with principal ID $p$.
If a principal $p$ is removed from the application during a disguise, \sys deletes any corresponding metadata, namely
the record of \pubk{p}.

\sys secures a principal $p$'s records by storing them in a record wrapper, and encrypting the wrapper
with \pubk{p}. Only a client holding the private key \privk{p}---the decryption
capability---can access these records.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Securing Disguise History.}
\sys should not leak information that $d$ disguised principal $p$ if $p$ interacts with the system
to reveal or otherwise access disguised data. In particular, \sys should avoid an adversary learning
that encrypted records exist for a particular $p$ and $d$, since this allows the adversary to deduce
that $d$ disguised $p$. For example, \sys should not reveal that a principal $p$ has invoked GDPR
deletion.

A strawman solution could store all encrypted records in one large bag, so those from
$d$ for $p$ are indistinguishable from those from $d'$ for $p'$. When \sys then gets a request for
records from disguise $d$ and for principal $p$, \sys attempts to decrypt (using a provided
decryption capability \privk{p}) all records in order to find the relevant ones.

To make this process more efficient, \sys uses \emph{locators \lcapa{pd}}. For each $p$ and $d$,
\sys stores encrypted records \tdiff{pd} and \town{pd} in a randomly located bag pointed to by
locator \lcapa{pd}. \sys returns all locators produced by a disguise to the application; to ensure
that locators don't leak information that disguise $d$ applied to $p$, \sys then forgets all locator
information, and the application should ensure that locators are stored external to the application
server (\eg by emailing them to the corresponding users).

Note that with this design, an adversary without access to \lcapa{pd} can learn that $n$ diffs exist
for \emph{some} $p$ and $d$, but cannot identify \emph{which} $p$ or $d$.
%
Furthermore, an adversary with access to decryption capability \privk{p} would not need locators to
discover $p$'s disguise history: they can decrypt every record in every bag to see which bags they
can successful decrypt. Using locators just makes such an attack less efficient.
%
These scenarios are outside our threat model.

\lyt{
An alternative design might remove encrypted records completely (and \eg store them in external per-user
vaults or email them to the client).
This leaves no trace in \sys or the application, and would prevent the adversary from learning
anything. However, this places a large burden on the client.
Maybe put this in future work?
}

To summarize, when \sys saves a disguise record $\mathcal{T}_{pd}$ from disguise $d$ associated with principal $p$, \sys:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item creates a record wrapper $W$ for the record $\mathcal{T}_{pd}$
    \item encrypts $W$ with \pubk{p} to produce $\enc(\pubk{p}, W)$
    \item stores $\enc(\pubk{p}, W)$ at location \lcapa{pd}
    \item returns \lcapa{pd} to the application, where it is sent to the appropriate user and then
        forgotten by the server
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Current Design: Discussion}
As the current design stands, \sys supports 1st-person and 3rd-person disguising, as well as
1st-person revealing.
%
Application developers can write GDPR-compliant and/or universal disguises with the primitives
exposed by \sys to write disguise specifications.
%
\sys uses diffs produced from disguising to reveal data when authorized to do so, and when
revealing does not revert updates made to the data since the time of disguise application.

%
\sys also supports ``Temporary Recorrelation without Database Changes'' because \sys can determine
the original owner of data as long as \sys has access to decorrelation diffs (which the client or
the application provides via the appropriate capabilities).
%
\sys can use information from decorrelation diffs to disguise decorrelated data as if it were owned
by the original user; and
%
\sys can support the API discussed in \S\ref{s:api}, which allows applications to query \sys to
check speaks-for relationships and grant authorized users personalized views and permissions to access
data objects.

Furthermore, \sys does this while meeting all security goals: \sys supports authorized disguises and
ensures the security of speaks-for claims, disguise diffs, and disguise history.

Our current design falls short, however, by failing to support ``Disguising Anonymized
Users'' which we explain next.
