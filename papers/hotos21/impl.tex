%
Our prototype disguising tool, \sys, is a disguising library written in 5K LoC of Rust.
%
%It supports standard SQL as well as \texttt{DISGUISE [disguise\_id] [target]} and
%\texttt{REVERSE DISGUISE [disguise\_id] [target]} queries, where \texttt{disguise\_id}
%identifies a declarative disguise specification and \texttt{target} is the unique ID
%of the target object.
%
\lyt{More here about the API?}
\sys provides data disguising for applications that use relational databases, where
objects are table rows and edges are foreign key relationships.
%
We believe that the data disguising approach can be extended to other types of stores.
