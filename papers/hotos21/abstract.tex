%\paragraph{Abstract.}

Conscientious application developers want to provide better user privacy,
and legal mandates and users increasingly demand it.
%
Better privacy often requires that applications transform the data they store
(\eg when a user deletes their account).
%
Unfortunately, privacy in complex, data-rich applications is fundamentally
hard: finding the affected data is nontrivial, and even once found, only some
of it should be removed; other data must be retained in anonymized form,
%(for legal reasons, or to maintain application utility for others),
and multiple different privacy-enhancing transformations might apply to the
same data at different times.
%
Burdening application developers with the correct implementation of these
transformations won't work.
%
%and some of these transformations should be reversible (in case a user wants to return).
%Furthermore, some of this data may have already been transformed by prior privacy requests,
%but this should not prevent the removal of the user's data.
%\lyt{I wanted to put in something about composition here, but I'm not sure if this really fits}
%
% Conscientious application developers face increasing legal and user demands to provide better privacy for their users.
% %    \lyt{Need some defn of privacy-enhancing data transformations?}
% % Malte: defined by example (account del)
% %
% But a conscientious developer has a tough job: privacy-enhancing transformations
% like account deletion require deleting, anonymizing, and decorrelating user data, while
% maintaining application utility for other users and any data retained for legal reasons.
%
% Consequently, today's applications support only simple, coarse-grained, and ad-hoc privacy
% transformations.
%

We propose \emph{data disguising}, a systematic approach that helps
developers apply privacy transformations in database-backed web applications.
%
Data disguising simplifies privacy transformations that applications use today,
    supports fine-grained and nuanced policies that would be cumbersome to implement manually,
    enables reversible transformations for users who change their mind,
    and automatically handles the complex interactions between transformations to correctly compose
    them.
%
%Furthermore, data reduce developer burden, as developers must no longer manually implement
%privacy transformations, and enable key new use cases, such as user-specific privacy modes.
%
A prototype tool for data disguising demonstrates that our approach is practical.
