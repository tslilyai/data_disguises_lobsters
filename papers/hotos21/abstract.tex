%\paragraph{Abstract.}

Conscientious application developers want to provide better user privacy;
legal mandates and user demand increasingly require it.
%
Unfortunately, privacy in complex, data-rich applications is fundamentally
hard. Consider a user who wants to remove their account from a service. Even
finding the corresponding data is nontrivial, but once it is found, only some
of it should be removed; other data should be anonymized or decorrelated (for
legal reasons, or to maintain application utility for other users), and some
of these transformations should be reversible (in case a user wants to
return).
%
% Conscientious application developers face increasing legal and user demands to provide better privacy for their users.
% %    \lyt{Need some defn of privacy-enhancing data transformations?}
% % Malte: defined by example (account del)
% %
% But a conscientious developer has a tough job: privacy-enhancing transformations
% like account deletion require deleting, anonymizing, and decorrelating user data, while
% maintaining application utility for other users and any data retained for legal reasons.
%
% Consequently, today's applications support only simple, coarse-grained, and ad-hoc privacy
% transformations.
%

We propose \emph{data disguising}, a systematic approach that helps developers generate
privacy transformations for database-backed web applications from a high-level specification
and preexisting data relationships.
%
Data disguising simplifies privacy transformations that applications use today, supports
fine-grained and nuanced policies that would be cumbersome to implement manually, and
enables reversible transformations for users who change their mind.
%
%Furthermore, data reduce developer burden, as developers must no longer manually implement
%privacy transformations, and enable key new use cases, such as user-specific privacy modes.
%
A prototype tool for data disguising demonstrates that our approach is practical.
