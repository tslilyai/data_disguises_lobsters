%\paragraph{Abstract.}


Providing privacy in complex, data-rich applications is fundamentally hard.
%
Deleting accounts, anonymizing an account's contributions, and other
privacy-related actions may require the traversal and transformation of
interwoven state in a relational database. This is hard enough---finding the affected
data can be nontrivial---but privacy actions must also balance competing
requirements, such as preserving data trails for legal reasons or allowing
users to change their mind.
%
% Even finding the data  to enforce new
% privacy policies. Even finding the data affected  data is nontrivial; even
% once found, only some of it should be removed; other data must be retained in
% anonymized form, (for legal reasons, or to maintain application utility for others),
%
% and multiple different privacy-enhancing transformations might apply to the
% same data at different times.
%
% Burdening application developers with the correct implementation of these
% transformations won't work.
%
%and some of these transformations should be reversible (in case a user wants to return).
%Furthermore, some of this data may have already been transformed by prior privacy requests,
%but this should not prevent the removal of the user's data.
%\lyt{I wanted to put in something about composition here, but I'm not sure if this really fits}
%
% Conscientious application developers face increasing legal and user demands to provide better privacy for their users.
% %    \lyt{Need some defn of privacy-enhancing data transformations?}
% % Malte: defined by example (account del)
% %
% But a conscientious developer has a tough job: privacy-enhancing transformations
% like account deletion require deleting, anonymizing, and decorrelating user data, while
% maintaining application utility for other users and any data retained for legal reasons.
%
% Consequently, today's applications support only simple, coarse-grained, and ad-hoc privacy
% transformations.
%
%
We believe a systematic shared framework for specifying and implementing
privacy transformations could simplify and empower applications.
%
Our prototype, \emph{data disguising}, supports fine-grained, nuanced, and
useful policies that would be cumbersome to implement manually, including
%
% a systematic approach that helps
%developers apply privacy transformations in database-backed web applications.
%
%Data disguising simplifies privacy transformations that applications use today,
%    supports fine-grained and nuanced policies that would be cumbersome to implement manually,
reversible transformations that can compose.
%
%A prototype tool for data disguising demonstrates that our approach is practical.
