%
We evaluate the ease of writing single disguises by writing disguises for GDPR deletion in
Lobsters~\cite{lobsters}, an open-source news feed application, and HotCRP~\cite{hotcrp}.
%
We consider four disguises: \lrtbf and \hrtbf implement the current account
deletion policies in the two applications~\cite{lobsters:privacy, hotcrp:privacy}.
%
\hrtbfplus specifies a HotCRP account deletion policy that balances useful data retention with
data deletion for privacy (\S\ref{design:eg}).
%
Finally, \hconfanon specifies the conference anonymization disguise for HotCRP.

\paragraph{Complexity.}
%
We would hope that writing disguises involves similar labor and difficulty as writing
relational schemas.
%
In particular, a developer should write a disguise only once.
%
Because disguises specify a set number of transformations for each object type,
disguise complexity is limited by the number of object types and relations in the
application schema.
%
Table~\ref{tab:loc} shows that the disguise specification for our applications is indeed
comparable in size to the applications' schemas.
%

\paragraph{Performance.}
\label{sec:perf}

Data disguising faces several performance challenges. 
%
First, disguise application should not unduly impact the performance of normal application queries.
\sys currently runs a disguise in one large SQL transaction, and performs transformation queries
sequentially; some batching and parallelization is possible and could improve this performance.
Furthermore, eventually consistent disguises would remove the expensive nature of a single large
transaction.  The importance of reducing the cost of disguise application depends on the rate of
disguising, which may range from rare (as in today's applications) to quite frequent (in a
privacy-supporting world where users freely disguise and reveal themselves, or where data
automatically ages out).

%
\sys must also be careful to do as little work as possible to handle disguise interdependencies. 
When executing a disguise, \sys not only modifies the relevant objects, but must also 
log all updates in the vault, and potentially read and reverse prior vault entries.
%
As expected, the number of queries performed by \sys to fetch and update the relevant to-be-disguised objects
grows linearly with the number of objects. This disguise overhead is unavoidable: these
modifications are crucial to ensuring proper disguise application. 
However, \sys could potentially need to read from, reverse, and reapply all entries in the vault
that correspond to all previous disguises.
