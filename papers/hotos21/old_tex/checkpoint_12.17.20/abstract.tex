\begin{abstract}
As users of web services grow increasingly aware of their rights to data ownership and data
protection, web services face greater legal and societal pressure to properly protect users'
privacy. 
%
These privacy demands require companies to properly delete and anonymize usersâ€™ data when a user
    requests to remove their data.
%
And beyond minimally satisfying these current legal requirements, putting ownership of personal data
    back in the hands of the user means granting the user the freedom to unsubscribe from a web
    service at any time, without losing their data and with the opportunity to come back later.

But unsubscribing users without compromising either the leaving user's
privacy or the application experience for the remaining users is difficult.
%
Removing too much information meets privacy requirements, but may yield
surprising application behavior (e.g.,\ disappearing content); removing too
little risks exposing the identity of unsubscribed users via inference
attacks.

In this paper, we propose \sys{}, a new system for safe unsubscription and
resubscription of users in database-backed web services.
%
\sys{} helps application developers specify fine-grained privacy policies to
meet de-identification requirements, and goes beyond: with \sys{}, 
users can flexibly switch between a privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode
and an identity-revealing subscribed mode at any time without permanently
losing their data.
%
This facilitates important new web service paradigms, such as users granting
a time-limited ``lease'' of data to a service instead of having a permanent
service account.
