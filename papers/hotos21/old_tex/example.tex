\section{An Example Disguise}
\label{design:eg}
%
Consider disguising Bob when he deletes his HotCRP account.
%
Bob would prefer his papers and reviews to be unlinked from his identity.
%
HotCRP, on the other hand, would like to retain paper and review information that other users
find useful.
%
An application developer can easily achieve both with disguises.
%A careful selection of edge and object transformations achieves both.
%

The application developer writes a short specification of the disguise. Bob is unlinked from his
reviews via a predicated-transformation that decorrelates any reviews that reference Bob.
%
This transforms Bob into one unique user guise per review.
%
The disguise generates guise attribute values using suitable defaults;
%
in particular, HotCRP users' \texttt{disabled} attribute is set for the guises, ensuring that guises
have no permissions and never review papers.
%

%
Bob is linked to papers through conflicts, which can indicate coauthorship or a reviewer conflict.
%
These conflicts are not reassigned to the new guises, since preserved conflicts could reidentify Bob
as the likely author of a review. Thus, conflicts predicated on linking Bob to papers will be
removed.

%The disguise leaves all other edge types, ensuring that review and paper artifacts remain correctly
%linked: active reviewers still see the correct paper for their reviews, and active authors see the
%correct reviews for their papers, albeit potentially authored by anonymous, unlinkable guises of the
%original reviewer.
Unlike the current real-world HotCRP account deletion policy~\cite{hotcrp:privacy}, which deletes
all objects belonging to Bob, this disguise strikes a balance between decorrelating Bob's identity
from his reviews and papers, and maintaining useful information for other HotCRP users.
%
Furthermore, it is easy to imagine extending this disguise to automatically disguise Bob after some
time (\eg 2 years after the conference), protecting his future research career by hiding youthful
reviewing sins.
%

The tool disguises Bob when he invokes HotCRP account deletion. Bob provides his secret key to
decrypt and read from his vault, allowing the tool to retrieve and temporarily reverse any conflicting,
reversible transformations that would make Bob's deletion fail: in particular, it recorrelates any
of Bob's decorrelated paper conflicts and then properly removes them. (Because the conflicts are
removed, the decorrelation is not reapplied).  Bob wants his account deletion disguise to be
reversible, so after performing the specified disguise updates, the tool records each transformation
in the vault, re-encrypts the vault, and forgets the key.
