Formalizig Dta Deletion in the Context of the RTBF

Data proteciton laws: GDPR, CCPA, fundamental right to data protection/privacy

Right to be forgotten: request company to delete any data collected about you
- what does it mean for data to be deleted?

COmplications:
- processing
    - depending on how data is stored, can leave "holes" in database --> sorted in alphabetical
      order, or if monotonically increasing
    - data processing has taken in data that may not be able to be delted
- property thta no "leftover" information remains


Goal: precisely define and understand behaviour of systems wrt data deleciton
- compare against a world where data never sent into sstem to begin with (no communication / effects
  by user): real world vs. ideal world
- replace all other users in system with "environment"

assume:
- user asks for all messages to be deleted
- environment and user runs in pollynomial time (in security parameter)
- environment can include those that app conveys information to (automatically not deletion-compiant
  --> conditional deletion-compliance means that all dependencies in env have to also delete
  correctly)

look at state of the memory, state of view from envinronment (exposed by application)
- must be similar: epsilon-deletion-compliant

solutions:
- history-independent data structures: memory looks same after deletion bc only depends on logical content of data
- publish statistics about data --> differential privacy

related work:
- deletion in ML (unlearning, history independence for ml models)

need good authentication mechanism

applicability:
- notion of history independence might be relevant
- notion of propagating definition among dependencies
