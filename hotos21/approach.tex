To enable developers to clearly specify data masks that can achieve both selective retention and
fine-grained data modification, we represent masks as transformations of
application data \emph{entity graphs}. Application data naturally encodes a graph of 
entity nodes and edges, where each entity type corresponds to an application table, such as a users,
papers, or reviews table. Edges between entities are foreign key relationships: foreign key table
columns create child-parent correlations, where the child entity holds the parent entity's
identifier as a foreign key. 
%\sys also includes abstract entities in the graph, where the keys may be non-referential
%identifiers that refer to abstract, non-table entities (e.g.,\ a \texttt{thread\_id} column in the
%comments table).  

Masks transform the entity graph by introducing \emph{ghost entities}, which both replace real
entities with (partially or fully) modified content, and break structural correlations. Data
retention, modification, and removal can be fully captured by specifying how to generate ghost
entities from real entities, and how to restructure the entity graph with edges to ghost entities.
Furthermore, \sys provides support for reversible transformations: developers can specify whether
\sys should log graph modifications performed by the mask. This allows \eg resubscription after unsubscription.

Developers declaratively specify the effects of the data mask as a \emph{data mask policy},
consisting of a set of transformation policies on entity types and edge types
(Section~\ref{sec:policies}). This declarative policy provides a precise post-mask specification for
users and developers. Developers use their application expertise to determine an acceptable
post-mask state that balances data retention with data modification and removal, all while
maintaining application correctness. Specifying post-mask state requires the developer to reason
only at the level of entity and edge \emph{types}, instead of about specific entity graph instances.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}, \sys sits between the application logic and its database. 
\sys takes a mask policy and schema annotations describing the application entity graph,
and systematically applies the appropriate mask transformations when invoked.
