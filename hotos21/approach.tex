\section{Approach}
To solve these challenges, we present \sys, a system that provides
abstractions and mechanisms to automate unsubscription and resubscription, and 
help developers of databased-backed web applications achieve correct, privacy-compliant user
unsubscription and resubscription without onerous labor.

\sys is based on the key observation that users' data can leak identifying information in two ways:
(1) directly via their content, and (2) indirectly via the structural \emph{correlations} they have
to other data in the system. 
Unsubscription must properly handle these information leaks, either through the removal of such data
or the \emph{decorrelation} of the data from the user's identity, and do so while preserving
application correctness.

%
Using \sys, developers pinpoint exactly which data and correlations may be identifying, and
specify the post-unsubscription state of this data. Developers provide a declarative
\emph{unsubscription policy} that indicates how the database contents need to change to meet
de-identification requirements on user unsubscription.
%
\sys then turns this policy into a set of concrete, executed database operations that remove,
anonymize, and structurally \emph{decorrelate} user data. \sys explicitly returns decorrelated or
removed user data to the unsubscribing user, and deletes it from the application.
%

%
When a user resubscribes, \sys re-imports missing data and \emph{recorrelates} the data with the
user account and other system data, restoring the user to her original subscribed state as much as
possible.

Furthermore, \sys transparently supports unsubscription and resubscription while still achieving performance
comparable to todayâ€™s widely-used databases and requiring no modification of application schemas.
