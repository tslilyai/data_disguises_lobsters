\section{Approach}
As a first step in solving these challenges, we present \sys, a system that provides abstractions
and mechanisms to help developers of databased-backed web applications achieve correct,
privacy-compliant, and automatic unsubscription and resubscription without onerous labor.

With \sys, developers write an \emph{unsubscription policy} that specifies the high-level,
post-unsubscription state of application data.  The policy indicates how the database contents need
to change to meet de-identification requirements on user unsubscription, while still retaining data
necessary for the application to function. \sys then turns this policy into a set of concrete,
executed database operations that systematically remove, anonymize, and structurally
\emph{decorrelate} user data upon unsubscription to meet the resulting spec. \sys explicitly
encrypts decorrelated or removed user data with a user-specific, password-protected key, returns the
encrypted blob to the application, and deletes the plaintext data from the application.  

\lyt{This
ends up trusting the application with the (encrypted/protected) key and encrypted data blob; since
applications want users to return, they'd be willing to store the data for them? And users could
optionally choose to dl their data and/or store their key themselves?}

\sys's policy abstractions require knowledge of only the application schema and the high-level
application's semantics. Using these abstractions, developers pinpoint how identifying information
leaks either (1) directly via data content, or (2) indirectly via the structural \emph{correlations}
(foreign key relationships) between data records. Developers then use their application expertise to
select from a set of policy choices that alter these contents and correlations, choosing the policy
that provides the greatest amount of de-identification while still preserving application
utility and correctness.

When a user resubscribes, \sys allows the application to re-import and decrypt missing data, and automatically
\emph{recorrelates} the data with the user account and other system data, restoring the user to her
original subscribed state as much as possible.

Furthermore, \sys transparently supports unsubscription and resubscription while still achieving performance
comparable to todayâ€™s widely-used databases and requiring no modification to application schemas or
architecture.
