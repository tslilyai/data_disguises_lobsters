\section{\sys Requirements \& Challenges}

To achieve \sys, a system must meet three requirements: it must (1) enable applications to
\emph{selectively retain} unsubscribed users' data for necessary legal or application purposes; (2)
properly \emph{de-identify} the user upon unsubscription by removing any possibly identifiable
information, or decorrelating this information from the user's identity; and (3) allow users to
\emph{resubscribe} without losing their account history or data, so unsubscription has no permanent
consequences. We next describe each requirement and the challenges to achieve it in greater detail.

\paragraph{Selective Retention.}
Retained data has two main purposes, to preserve legal or
necessary information about an individual user (\eg order history in e-commerce applications), and
to maintains application utility for other subscribed users of the application.  Social media
applications retain private messages for thread coherence; news feed applications like Reddit retain
previous posts, the main source of utility for other users of the sites.  HotCRP, conference review
and paper submission software, indefinitely stores and distributes submissions and reviews so users
can reference their past reviews and paper feedback. Strava, a workout tracking social network,
retains geolocation data for other users to see which routes are popular.

Under \sys, developers should be able to to specify exactly what data to retain 
post-unsubscription, and prevent accidental data deletion or retention.

\paragraph{De-Identification.}
If applications retain data, this data should be properly de-identified. As shown in
Table~\ref{tab:apps}, applications often fail to do so.
Those applications that do make efforts to de-identify data replace user identifiers with a
placeholder user identifier, or remove user-associated data. However, simply removing or
anonymizing user identifiers often fails to sufficiently de-identify retained data. Correlations
from retained data to \emph{other} application data or metadata can still identify unsubscribed
users. For example, PrestaShop orders with the same timestamp, or ordered to the same location
likely belong to the same user, and a user's order history can be clearly identifying.  Anonymized
posts with the same flairs or custom tags on Reddit or Lobsters can identify which user made the
posts.

Because of these subtle and complex indirect information leaks from data relationships, many
applications choose to forgo data retention completely in order to ensure proper de-identification.
For example, when HotCRP users unsubscribe, 
%While HotCRP developers would prefer to retain review and paper data, doing so while de-identifying
%the user is not easy. 
HotCRP cannot only remove user identifiers: correlations with data such as conflicts with other
reviewers can indirectly identify the user's affiliation and recent collaborations, and the user
themselves. Instead, HotCRP chooses to reduce its utility for others users by completely removing
the unsubscribing user's data, a solution that clearly would not work in a world where users
frequently unsubscribe at any time.
%HotCRP removes the user's data completely, at the cost of other users who reference those reviews
%and papers. 

Under \sys, developers should be able to easily detect, specify, and modify or remove problematic
content or correlations, and users should know exactly what identifying information may be left
behind. However, the \sys paradigm does not aim to completely solve the open problem of achieving sufficient
de-identification and anonymization.

\paragraph{Resubscription.}
Resubscription must recorrelate any retained data with the original owner, and restore any removed
data. Today, applications either retain all data and forgo de-identification entirely
(Facebook/Twitter Account Deactivation) to support resubscription, or remove and anonymize data
permanently without allowing users to resubscribe. Supporting resubscription requires storing
information necessary for recorrelation and restoring users' accounts, but should not unduly burden
either the application or user, or add any identifying information about unsubscribing users to the
system.

%HotCRP
%users---particularly reviewers---would prefer that their blinded reviews never become publically
%associated with their identity in the case of a data compromise. 
%

%Reviewers and authors create user accounts to
%ubmit or review papers, and HotCRP supports program committee conflict detection, paper rebuttals
%nd comments, review delegation, and other features necessary for the conference review process.
%HotCRP's current privacy policy~\cite{hotcrp:privacy} allows site managers (e.g.,\ program chairs)
%to indefinitely store and distribute submissions and reviews.  This is by request of its users:
%users want to be able to reference prior conference reviews and paper metadata.  

%Currently, the only way to ensure this is to contact the HotCRP maintainers directly to manually
%remove their user profile: the HotCRP developers considered automating support for unsubscription
%and found it too cumbersome to implement. 
%
%\lyt{(This isn't exactly what I want to say---sorry to put words in your mouth, Eddie!---but something like this is
%probably useful.)} 
%
%When user accounts are removed, every piece of data ever associated with that
%user is deleted from the system: this model clearly would not work if all users freely
%unsubscribed at will, as the system would be left with no useful data for subscribed users.
%
%The desired HotCRP unsubscription behavior would both retain useful data for HotCRP and its users,
%and satisfy the desire of HotCRP users to de-identify their data. In particular, the HotCRP
%developers should be able to specify that unsubscription deletes only the user profile, and
%\emph{decorrelates} the links between the user and their reviews (and other user-associated data)
%while retaining the blinded reviews and data for other users to view. While correlations between
%users and their reviews are obviously identifying, unsubscription must also handle more subtle
%correlations: a user's reviewer conflicts can identify the user's affiliation and recent
%collaborations, and in many cases, the user themselves. Implementing unsubscription that handles
%these complex data relationships correctly would not be trivial.
