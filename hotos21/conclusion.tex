We propose \name, a new paradigm of data ownership on the web that provides users with control over
when and how applications access their data, without overhauling the current web architecture and
business model. To realize \name, we design \sys, which minimizes the burden upon users to store or
manage their data, and makes it easy for developers to systematically express and automate the
subtle and complex data transformations needed for unsubscription and resubscription. We demonstrate
how \sys can be used in practical web applications with low overhead.
