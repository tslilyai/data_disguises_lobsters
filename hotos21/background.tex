 \caption{The characteristics of unsubscription in a range of web applications.
    \LEFTcircle indicates that the application permits some user data to remain identifiable
    post-subscription, but de-identifies other data in its privacy policy.}
    \label{tab:apps}
\end{table*}

We study support for unsubscription and resubscription in a range of web
services, including enterprise and open-source social media and news-feed applications such as
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and Lobsters; e-Commerce applications such as
Amazon and PrestaShop; and other specialized services such as HotCRP, GitHub, Spotify, and Strava.
Table~\ref{tab:apps} summarizes the unsubscription characteristics of each application. We focus on
four characteristics: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is unsubscription automated, or does the user need to email or call the
application developers or customer service directly? 
    \item Does the application's privacy policy (or
        code, when available) promise to de-identify all the unsubscribing user's data, 
        either via deletion or
        decorrelation of the data from the user's identity? 
    \item Does the application retain any of the unsubscribing user data, or is all data removed?
    \item Does unsubscription allow for resubscription, in which unsubscribed users can regain control of their
        account and account data?
\end{enumerate}

Fewer than half of the services surveyed provide automated unsubscription; all others require the
user to email or call the application maintainers or support. This indicates the difficulty of
automating unsubscription correctly, and consequently makes it more  
inconvenient for users to unsubscribe.

All applications retain some user information in some form: for example, Facebook retains copies of
private messages for other users in the conversation; Reddit retains all posts and comments made by
the user; Lobsters retains the user's unique username and logs of the user's actions; e-commerce
sites retain a user's order history; and Strava retains geolocation data and any
``necessary'' information. All applications specify that any
``required'' information can be retained, for legal or applications correctness purposes (e.g., to
process payments, or to keep the coherence of private messaging threads).

Many applications state that some portions of the retained data will be decorrelated from the
unsubscribed user's identity. For example, Reddit, PrestaShop, and GitHub explicitly state that all
remaining posts, orders, and comments will be reassociated with a global placeholder user.
However, as indicated in Table~\ref{tab:apps}, many applications either leave some data identifiable
(e.g., private messages in Facebook and Twitter), or fail to specify whether some or all of the ``required''
information will be de-identified.

Of the applications surveyed, only Facebook/Instagram and Twitter support some form of
resubscription. However, unsubscribing via account deactivation only hides user-added content from
other users: all user data remains in the system without being de-identified.  All other forms of
unsubscription across all applications permanently remove access to the user's account; even if the
application retains user data (such as orders on Amazon, or posts on Reddit), the user cannot regain
ownership of these records.

%Reddit~\cite{reddit:privacy} account deletion reassociates user data with a global ghost user, but
%all user posts, comments, and messages that have not been explicitly been removed by the user remain
%present but anonymized in the system. Users have no ability to resubscribe and regain
%ownership of these pieces of data that remain in the system. 
%
%Hacker News~\cite{hackernews:privacy} allows users to submit requests via email or phone to delete
%personal information, but reserves the right to refuse to delete content or remove associations with
%a user's identity.  Users cannot resubscribe and regain access to their prior profiles.
%
%Lobsters has no privacy policy~\cite{lobsters:privacy}. All user actions and moderations are
%%logged, enforcing Lobster's culture of transparent user accountability. A user can request to delete
%their account, which deletes only a users' private messages and negatively-scored comments; all
%stories and comments can optionally be reassociated with a global ghost user instead of the original
%user. In all cases, Lobsters privately retains the user's unique username, and leave log entries of users'
%actions unmodified.
%
%Amazon~\cite{amazon:privacy} allows users to request to delete their personal data by contacting
%Customer Service, with the warning that services become limited or unavailable when the user does
%so. There is no option to unsubscribe or delete an Amazon account from a user's Amazon account
%management page.  A user can also choose to permanently close her account~\cite{amazon:close}. If
%so, Amazon specifies that content is deleted from Photos and Drive, but potentially retains all other types
%of data, such as order history. Even though Amazon can retain profile data, a user can never
%again regain access to her account, losing access to purchased e-books or movies, gift card
%balances, Prime shipping, and more.
%
%%PrestaShop~\cite{prestashop:privacy} is an open-source e-commerce web service, and has explicit GDPR
%policies for its merchants when a customer requests to delete their account: their personal account
%details (age, email, address) are removed, but order invoices and abandoned carts are transferred to
%an anonymous account. Users cannot resubscribe.
%
%HotCRP's current privacy policy~\cite{hotcrp:privacy} allows site managers (e.g.,\ program chairs)
%to indefinitely store and distribute submissions and reviews. Each HotCRP.com user has an associated
%global profile and a profile for every HotCRP.com site, and must contact the HotCRP maintainers
%directly to remove these profiles.
%
%GitHub~\cite{github:privacy} reassociates some retained user content (contributions, comments on
%issues) with a global ghost user, and removes all other account information. However, user email
%addresses associated with commits remain unchanged. A user cannot resubscribe.
%
%Spotify~\cite{spotify:privacy} allows users to close their accounts, at the cost of permanently
%losing all account data (playlists, followers, etc.) Spotify promises to ``delete or anonymise...
%personal data so that it no longer identifies [the user], unless [they] are legally allowed or
%required to maintain certain personal data.'' Spotify does not specify exactly what data is
%retained.
%
%Strava~\cite{strava:privacy} users can request account deletion, which ``permanently and
%irreversibly'' deletes all personal data. Resubscription is not supported. Any content that is
%shared with others remains unanonymized after account deletion, as well as any ``necessary''
%information. Strava also retains unnecessary user data such as geolocation information, and promises
%to de-identify this data.
