\subsection{Decoupling User Data from Web Applications}
Our proposed subscription paradigm contrasts with a model of strong privacy in web appliactions, in
which the user has complete data ownership (see Figure~\ref{fig:world}b). In proposals for this
model~\cite{solid, amber, w5, blockstack, bstore}, applications must compute on per-user, filesystem-esque
storage, \eg as JavaScript in users' browsers in Solid~\cite{solid}, Blockstack~\cite{blockstack} and
BStore~\cite{bstore}. Applications face the loss of the flexibility and ease of programming over SQL
databases with application-specific schemas, and users must decide on appropriate access control and
authentication policies. As a result, service-side computation and data sharing between users---a
large reason users use applications to begin with---becomes inefficient and impractical. 
%
Furthermore, users are burdened with long-term data maintenance and storage: solutions that use PKI
(\eg Blockstack~\cite{blockstack}) require users to maintain a
master private key, a cumbersome and fragile solution in which losing the key results in permanent
loss of all the user's data.
%
Finally, users must change the way they pay for services, as the current revenue model for
applications relies on access to user data. 
\lyt{this might not be a bad thing, though}.

Under the subscription paradigm, applications do not need to access any data outside its own
servers, simplifying the secure storage of this data when users enter privacy-preserving mode.
Applications can operate as they do today, with the current web architecture's performance and
programming flexibility benefits. However, unlike today's model of data privacy in web applications,
users can freely reclaim their their data and privacy whenever they wish.

\subsection{Data Anonymization}

Prior research on k-anonymization, pseudonymization (more for static analysis purposes than used in
web applications).

While psuedo/anonymization
techniques still allow for reidentification/reconstruction attacks), \sys{} provides better
anonymization than prior approaches, which decorrelate only coarsely by associating remnants of data
with a global placeholder for all deleted users, or do not decorrelate at all (e.g., replacing
usernames with a pseudonym, as in the AOL dataset case~\lyt{TODO}%\cite{aol}).

\subsection{Differentially Private Queries}

PINQ, a data analysis platform created by McSherry~\cite{pinq}, provides formal differential privacy
guarantees for any query allowed by the platform.  Data analysts using PINQ can perform
transformations (Where, Union, GroupBy, and restricted Join operations) on the underlying data
records prior to extracting information via aggregations (e.g., counts, sums, etc.) The aggregation
results include added noise to meet the given privacy budget $\epsilon$, ensuring that analysts only
ever receive $\epsilon$-differentially-private results.  PINQ calculates the privacy loss of any
given query based on transformations and aggregations to be performed; if a particular query exceeds
a predefined privacy budget, PINQ refuses to execute the query.

Differential privacy provides a formal framework that defines the privacy loss a user incurs
when the user's data is included in the dataset. However, the setting of differential privacy
that of \sys{} in several important ways. 

First, web applications' utility often derives from visibility into individual data records. PINQ
restricts JOIN transformation and exposes information only through differentially-private
aggregation mechanisms. While sufficient for many data analyses, this approach severely hinders web
application functionality. \sys{} supports all application queries, even ones that expose individual
records, such as \texttt{SELECT story.content, story.tag FROM stories LIMIT 10}.  
However, this makes formally defining the privacy guarantees of \sys{} more complex than
simply applying DP.  DP provides formal guarantees for results such as sums or averages because such
results are computed using well-defined mathematics, allowing us to neatly capture the total
knowledge gained by the adversary. However, in the world of web applications, the knowledge gained
via queries that may reveal individual data records cannot be so easily defined: adversaries may
learn information from the friends who liked the (ghosted) story, or the time and location the story
was posted.

Thus, we cannot, in general, use the DP approach of asking, ``by how much do answers to adversary
queries change with the presence of a users' decorrelated data?'' While we can precisely define which
data records an adversary sees with and without a user's decorrelated data, we cannot numerically
quantify the knowledge gained by the adversary in the same way as we can quantify the percentage
change to a sum or average.
Instead, \sys{} reduces identifying information in the changes induced by a users' (decorrelated)
data, rather than reducing the amount of change itself.

This is demonstrated by how PINQ and \sys{} differ in masking entities associated with unique keys.
PINQ restricts JOINs to group by unique keys. As an (imperfect) example, selecting a JOIN of stories
with users via the UID would result in a record, one per UID, which represents the ``group'' of all
stories associated with a user. A normal join would create a separate record per story, each
associated with the user of that UID.

Instead of lumping all matching stories together, \sys{} explodes the users' UID into individual
unique keys (ghosts), one per story. By PINQ's analysis of stable transformations, this leads to
unbounded stability (as the number of different results produced by queries is proportional to the
potentially very large number of stories for that user). In PINQ's DP framework, such unbounded
stability leads to unbounded privacy loss: one users' data could change aggregation results in
``significant'' ways unless huge amounts of noise were added. 

\sys{} and PINQ's approaches can be seen as complementary: for queries that are more analytic in nature (for example,
population statistics used by the web application to measure usage or trends), \sys{} can utilize
PINQ's technique to provide differentially private guarantees (for a particular snapshot of the
dataset).  \sys{}'s decorrelation, in fact, adds more noise than necessary in these cases: a count
of unique users who posted about cats will be more imprecise because each post by a decorrelated
user is now associated with a unique (ghost) user.

\subsection{Deletion Privacy}
The right to be forgotten has also been formally defined by Garg et
al.~\cite{garg}, where correct deletion corresponds to the notion of
leave-no-trace: the state of the data collection system after a user requests to be forgotten should
be left (nearly) indistinguishable from that where the user never existed to begin with. While
\sys{} uses a similar comparison, Garg et al.'s formalization assumes that users operate
independently, and that the centralized data collector prevents one user's data from influencing
another's.
