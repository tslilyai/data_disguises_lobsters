\paragraph{Designs for GDPR Compliance.}
Several systems propose designs to make it easier for applications to comply with the GDPR right to
be forgotten.

Sypse~\cite{sypse} pseudonymizes user data, partitioning personally identifying information (PII)
from non-identifying data, and allowing the application to use the latter for legal or processing
purposes. 
Unlike Sypse's partitioning scheme, \sys does not keep PII after a data mask, or change the
application schema in any way.
Sypse, like \sys, sits between application's logic and data, and breaks
foreign key relationships and objects grouped by user. However, Sypse assumes a specification of
which objects to pseudonymize and which correlations to break, whereas we observe that writing these
specifications is itself a challenging problem, and propose abstractions that allow developers to
precisely capture application-specific behavior. 
%We concretely define the application entity graph
%and abstractions that allow developers to reason about it, whereas Sypse leaves this as future work.
Sypse creates synthetic data similar to ghost entities; however,
Sypse's synthesis is random and application-oblivious. We make the observation that in order to maintain correct application semantics, developers must provide input into how to generate ghost entities.

%Instead of constantly maintaining data partitions, \sys performs data masking when invoked and
%incurs little overhead during normal execution. A future implementation may preemptively create
%ghost data and result in a system design vaguely similar to Sypse, but this implementation strategy
%is not fundamental.
%Sypse also does not support resubscription, although we observe that a similar approach to ours
%would allow Sypse to do so.

%---------------------------
Schwartzkopf et al.~\cite{usershards} propose a data model for GDPR compliant-by-construction
systems, splitting application data into user shards. This model is orthogonal to \sys's design:
\sys's mask policy abstractions support revocation of data that must be retained or shared in this
model.

%---------------------------
SchengenDB~\cite{schengendb} identifies PII and restricts query access to PII using purpose-based
access control. SchengenDB performs fine-grained tracking of PII copies and data derived
from PII, going beyond correlations visible in the entity relation graph of foreign key
relationships; SchengenDB deletes records tracked with the owner when the owner unsubscribes.
While similar tracking can be added to \sys to support derived data not visible in the entity graph,
\sys focuses on automating data masking transformations that require more than PII data deletion. 

%---------------------------

Frameworks such as Jeeves~\cite{jeeves} aid developers in enforcing IFC policies that specify how
sensitive values should be disclosed by a program. Like \sys, the framework also relies on
developers to specify appropriate policies, and simply enforces them. However, \sys works in the
domain of database data transformations and applies mask policies only when invoked, whereas Jeeves
does not modify data and instead monitors program behavior at runtime to track where and how data is
disclosed.  \lyt{I'm not sure that this is that related, but it came up in PDOS...}

%Sieve~\cite{sieve} focus on defining access control to PII, but doesn't actually change data. 

%ScrambleDB~\cite{scrambledb} generates oblivious pseudonyms for distributed settings, so there does
%not need to be one trusted central pseudonym/linking server.

%---------------------------

\paragraph{Decoupling User Data from Web Applications.} 
Prior work~\cite{diy, solid, amber, oort, w5, blockstack, bstore, databox} has proposed user-centric data
ownership paradigms which decouple user data from applications. Applications agree upon a standard
format for data storage, and compute on decentralized, per-user datastores hosted by a trusted
third-party provider or the user. Application logic runs on user clients (\eg JavaScript in users'
browsers~\cite{solid, blockstack, bstore}), and queries individual datastores to access user data.

Although these paradigms grant users more control over applications' access to their data, users
must decide on appropriate access control and authentication policies, and are burdened with
long-term data maintenance and storage. If users do not self-host, they must trust (and potentially
pay for) a third party provider to manage their data. Current providers in Solid~\cite{solid}
provide no security or stability guarantees, and others that use PKI (\eg
Blockstack~\cite{blockstack}) require users to maintain a master private key, a fragile solution in
which losing the key results in permanent loss of all the user's data.
%https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html

Many applications that perform data-intensive service-side computation and rely on data sharing
between users (\eg online stores or social networks) experience large performance loss due to the
additional access control checks and remote queries to user datastores. Application
developers can no longer program over application-specific SQL databases, and lose the flexibility and performance that results from specialized schemas and data storage.
Decoupling user data also eliminates the current revenue model for web applications, which relies on access
to user data. Projects such as Solid~\cite{solid} currently rely on open-source application
development, and free hosting by providers, a revenue model that may be unsustainable
long-term.

In contrast, \sys is a tool to help applications specify and automate user data management, and
does not require changing the application data model.

%provides a middle ground between the current data ownership paradigm (web
%applications owning all user data), and these paradigms which decouple of user data from web applications. 
%While \name lacks a single, unified data location where users store all their data,
%users gain control access to their personal data by taking it back from applications at will, without
%any permanent consequences.  \name preserves the current web architecture and all
%its performance benefits, removing the need for applications to compute over and query for remote
%data.  When users enter privacy-preserving mode, \name does not require the user
%to secure or manage this data, or handle the intricacies of access control (described in
%Section~\ref{sec:design:storage}).

%---------------------------

\paragraph{Statistical Privacy Guarantees.}
Approaches for privacy-preserving data mining, such as $k$-anonymity, $l$-diversity, and
differential privacy~\cite{dataminingmodels}, are complementary to \sys: for queries that are
analytic in nature, \name can utilize techniques like PINQ~\cite{pinq} to provide differentially
private guarantees. However, \sys allows arbitrary application queries over arbitrary content, where
these statistical techniques no longer apply.

Key ideas:
    pseudonymization 
    data partitioning
    synthetic data

Similarities:
- privacy guarantees weaker than DP, no constraints on queries
- pseudonymization --> overwrite a portion or all of data for individual, difficult to reassociate
    only a small fraction of data?
    breaking up objects grouped by user identifier key
    breaking connections between tables (just like )

- try to ensure that database still useful even w/pseudonymization
    synthetic data (ghosts in \name) 
- use of in-memory caches to avoid expensive joins (materialized views)

Differences
- design for \name puts data in hands of user, Sypse has a separate partitioned table (not
necessarily )
- Sypse has synthetic data generation instead of ghosts to replace data taken out
    - foreign keys point to random records
    - VS ghost records
    - not developer-specified? might lead to incorrect behavior?
- what are partitions?
    - limited access, the queries will be run against pseudonymized or syntheticdata only 
    - Detail Database: anything that isn't PII (pseudonymous)
        - perform analysis, data mining, etc. on these
    - PII Database: anything tied to specific individual (username, user identifiers)
        - replaces with surrogate keys
        - geological / biometric information
        - breaking up objects grouped by user identifier key (direct edge policies)
        - breaking connections between tables (non-direct edge policies)
    - backed up separately, different access control mechanisms
- assumes annotated schema, but doesn't actually describe it!!! just says requires analysis, or is
relatively straightforward
    -made automatically through a continuous analysis ofthe database schema and the data within it,
    visible to users
    - lack of schema discipline in practice (Database decay and how to avoid it.)
    - no undersatnding of multiple entities and how they relate to each other
- no support for resubscription

Partition strategies:
- split table into multiple tables, additional joins to reconnect different partitions, doubled updates, forgetting requires multiple
updates
- encrypt certain attributes, add as new attributes, encrypted keys stored in user->key mapping: joins limited
- us: we don't care about size of "PII" table --> this data is given to user

\subsection{Decoupling User Data from Web Applications}
Our proposed subscription paradigm contrasts with a model of strong privacy in web appliactions, in
which the user has complete data ownership (see Figure~\ref{fig:world}b). In proposals for this
model~\cite{solid, amber, w5, blockstack, bstore}, applications must compute on per-user, filesystem-esque
storage, \eg as JavaScript in users' browsers in Solid~\cite{solid}, Blockstack~\cite{blockstack} and
BStore~\cite{bstore}. Applications face the loss of the flexibility and ease of programming over SQL
databases with application-specific schemas, and users must decide on appropriate access control and
authentication policies. As a result, service-side computation and data sharing between users---a
large reason users use applications to begin with---becomes inefficient and impractical. 
%
Furthermore, users are burdened with long-term data maintenance and storage: solutions that use PKI
(\eg Blockstack~\cite{blockstack}) require users to maintain a
master private key, a cumbersome and fragile solution in which losing the key results in permanent
loss of all the user's data.
%
Finally, users must change the way they pay for services, as the current revenue model for
applications relies on access to user data. 
\lyt{this might not be a bad thing, though}.

Under the subscription paradigm, applications do not need to access any data outside its own
servers, simplifying the secure storage of this data when users enter privacy-preserving mode.
Applications can operate as they do today, with the current web architecture's performance and
programming flexibility benefits. However, unlike today's model of data privacy in web applications,
users can freely reclaim their their data and privacy whenever they wish.

\subsection{Data Anonymization}

Prior research on k-anonymization, pseudonymization (more for static analysis purposes than used in
web applications).
%\url{https://amnesia.openaire.eu/index.html}
%\url{https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.32.pdf}

While psuedo/anonymization
techniques still allow for reidentification/reconstruction attacks), \name provides better
anonymization than prior approaches, which decorrelate only coarsely by associating remnants of data
with a global placeholder for all deleted users, or do not decorrelate at all (e.g., replacing
usernames with a pseudonym, as in the AOL dataset case~\lyt{TODO}%\cite{aol}).

\subsection{Differentially Private Queries}

PINQ, a data analysis platform created by McSherry~\cite{pinq}, provides formal differential privacy
guarantees for any query allowed by the platform.  Data analysts using PINQ can perform
transformations (Where, Union, GroupBy, and restricted Join operations) on the underlying data
records prior to extracting information via aggregations (e.g., counts, sums, etc.) The aggregation
results include added noise to meet the given privacy budget $\epsilon$, ensuring that analysts only
ever receive $\epsilon$-differentially-private results.  PINQ calculates the privacy loss of any
given query based on transformations and aggregations to be performed; if a particular query exceeds
a predefined privacy budget, PINQ refuses to execute the query.

Differential privacy provides a formal framework that defines the privacy loss a user incurs
when the user's data is included in the dataset. However, the setting of differential privacy
that of \name in several important ways. 

First, web applications' utility often derives from visibility into individual data records. PINQ
restricts JOIN transformation and exposes information only through differentially-private
aggregation mechanisms. While sufficient for many data analyses, this approach severely hinders web
application functionality. \name supports all application queries, even ones that expose individual
records, such as \texttt{SELECT story.content, story.tag FROM stories LIMIT 10}.  
However, this makes formally defining the privacy guarantees of \name more complex than
simply applying DP.  DP provides formal guarantees for results such as sums or averages because such
results are computed using well-defined mathematics, allowing us to neatly capture the total
knowledge gained by the adversary. However, in the world of web applications, the knowledge gained
via queries that may reveal individual data records cannot be so easily defined: adversaries may
learn information from the friends who liked the (ghosted) story, or the time and location the story
was posted.

Thus, we cannot, in general, use the DP approach of asking, ``by how much do answers to adversary
queries change with the presence of a users' decorrelated data?'' While we can precisely define which
data records an adversary sees with and without a user's decorrelated data, we cannot numerically
quantify the knowledge gained by the adversary in the same way as we can quantify the percentage
change to a sum or average.
Instead, \name reduces identifying information in the changes induced by a users' (decorrelated)
data, rather than reducing the amount of change itself.

This is demonstrated by how PINQ and \name differ in masking entities associated with unique keys.
PINQ restricts JOINs to group by unique keys. As an (imperfect) example, selecting a JOIN of stories
with users via the UID would result in a record, one per UID, which represents the ``group'' of all
stories associated with a user. A normal join would create a separate record per story, each
associated with the user of that UID.

Instead of lumping all matching stories together, \name explodes the users' UID into individual
unique keys (ghosts), one per story. By PINQ's analysis of stable transformations, this leads to
unbounded stability (as the number of different results produced by queries is proportional to the
potentially very large number of stories for that user). In PINQ's DP framework, such unbounded
stability leads to unbounded privacy loss: one users' data could change aggregation results in
``significant'' ways unless huge amounts of noise were added. 

\name and PINQ's approaches can be seen as complementary: for queries that are more analytic in nature (for example,
population statistics used by the web application to measure usage or trends), \name can utilize
PINQ's technique to provide differentially private guarantees (for a particular snapshot of the
dataset).  \name's decorrelation, in fact, adds more noise than necessary in these cases: a count
of unique users who posted about cats will be more imprecise because each post by a decorrelated
user is now associated with a unique (ghost) user.

\subsection{Deletion Privacy}
The right to be forgotten has also been formally defined by Garg et
al.~\cite{garg}, where correct deletion corresponds to the notion of
leave-no-trace: the state of the data collection system after a user requests to be forgotten should
be left (nearly) indistinguishable from that where the user never existed to begin with. While
\name uses a similar comparison, Garg et al.'s formalization assumes that users operate
independently, and that the centralized data collector prevents one user's data from influencing
another's.
