%
We propose a new data ownership paradigm for web services that achieves
better user privacy and data protection than today's services, but without
making impractical assumptions or breaking the business model.
%

%
Users subscribe to a service by granting a \emph{lease} to their data,
instead of having a permanent account.
%
When the lease ends, the service switches the user from the identity-revealing
subscribed mode into a privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode, where the
service only retains anonymized data about them.
%
Users can thus withdraw from a service without permanently losing access,
as they can resubscribe at any time, and a user's withdrawal does not affect
the service's utility for other users.
%
%This subscription paradigm strikes a balance between applications having
%complete ownership of user data, and users owning and storing their data at
%the cost of application utility.
%

%
A prototype implementation of this paradigm suggests it can be realized
efficiently and with low burden for application developers.
%
\ms{We should give our paradigm a name!}

%
%    In order to achieve this subscription paradigm, application developers must balance
%    between retaining enough information so the application correctly and usefully functions, and
%    removing enough information to prevent disclosing the identity of unsubscribed users via
%    inference attacks. To begin to solve these challenges, we design \sys{}, a new system that
%    automates privacy-compliant unsubscription and resubscription of users in database-backed web
%    applications.
