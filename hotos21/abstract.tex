\begin{abstract}
The paper proposes a new web service paradigm, in which users grant a time-limited ``lease'' of data
to a service instead of having a permanent service account. Users flexibly switch between a
privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode and an identity-revealing subscribed mode at any time
without permanently losing their data. This model strikes a balance between one extreme of no
privacy, in which applications have complete ownership of user data, and another extreme in
which users own and store their data at the cost of application utility.

However, achieving this balance is difficult.  Application developers must balance between retaining
enough information so the application correctly and usefully functions, and removing enough
information to prevent disclosing the identity of unsubscribed users via inference attacks.  To
solve these challenges, we design \sys{}, a new system for safe unsubscription and
resubscription of users in database-backed web services.
