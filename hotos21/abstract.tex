\begin{abstract}
As users of web services grow increasingly aware of their data ownership and protection rights, web
    services face greater legal and societal pressure to properly delete and anonymize usersâ€™ data
    when a user requests to leave.
%
And truly putting ownership of personal data back in the hands of the user requires more than minimally
    satisfying the current legal requirements: applications should grant the user the freedom to unsubscribe
    from a web service at any time, with the opportunity to later
    resubscribe without permanently losing their data.

But unsubscribing users without compromising either the leaving user's
privacy or the application experience for remaining users is difficult.
%
Application developers must balance between retaining enough information so the application
    correctly and usefully functions, and removing enough information to prevent disclosing the
    identity of unsubscribed users via inference attacks.
%Removing too much information meets privacy requirements, but may yield
%surprising application behavior (e.g.,\ disappearing content); removing too
%little risks exposing the identity of unsubscribed users via inference
%attacks.

In this paper, we propose \sys{}, a new system for safe unsubscription and
resubscription of users in database-backed web services.
%
\sys{} helps application developers specify fine-grained privacy policies to
meet de-identification requirements, and goes beyond: with \sys{}, 
users can flexibly switch between a privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode
and an identity-revealing subscribed mode at any time without permanently
losing their data.
%
This facilitates important new web service paradigms, such as users granting
a time-limited ``lease'' of data to a service instead of having a permanent
service account.
