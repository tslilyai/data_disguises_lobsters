\begin{abstract}
We propose a new web service paradigm, in which users grant a time-limited ``lease'' of data to
a service instead of having a permanent service account.  In this model, users flexibly switch
between a privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode and an identity-revealing subscribed mode at any
time without permanently losing their data.

%
But unsubscribing users without compromising either the leaving user's
privacy or the application experience for remaining users is difficult.
%
Application developers must balance between retaining enough information so the application
    correctly and usefully functions, and removing enough information to prevent disclosing the
    identity of unsubscribed users via inference attacks.
%Removing too much information meets privacy requirements, but may yield
%surprising application behavior (e.g.,\ disappearing content); removing too
%little risks exposing the identity of unsubscribed users via inference
%attacks.
To solve these challenges, we design \sys{}, a new system for safe unsubscription and
resubscription of users in database-backed web services.
