\begin{abstract}
    The paper proposes a new web application paradigm in which users subscribe to applications by
    granting a time-limited ``lease'' of their data, instead of having a permanent account. Users
    flexibly switch between a privacy-preserving unsubscribed mode and an identity-revealing
    subscribed mode at any time without permanently losing their data. This subscription paradigm
    strikes a balance between one extreme in which applications have complete ownership of user
    data, and another extreme in which users own and store their data at the cost of application
    utility.

    Achieving this subscription paradigm is difficult. Application developers must balance
    between retaining enough information so the application correctly and usefully functions, and
    removing enough information to prevent disclosing the identity of unsubscribed users via
    inference attacks. To begin to solve these challenges, we design \sys{}, a new system that
    automates privacy-compliant unsubscription and resubscription of users in database-backed web
    applications.
