\lyt{TODO (Frans): drive w/explicit example of table rows and foreign key relationships, too
abstract. Start with Figure~\ref{fig:arch}?}

%
The key idea behind \emph{data disguising} is to associate multiple \emph{guises} with a target
data object: some guises are identity-revealing, others are privacy-preserving.
%
Objects move between different guises by means of privacy transformations.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:example} illustrates this with the example of user unsubscription: in subscribed
state, user Alice's profile is associated with her true identity (an identity-revealing guise)
and all her contributions to the site.
%
When Alice unsubscribes, however, the her profile and contributions move to different,
privacy-preserving guises: her profile is now associated with an anonymizing name, her email
address redacted, and her contributions are decorrelated and attributed to individual,
unidentified author guises.
%

%
Data disguising builds on existing structural information in web applications' data.
%


\ms{old follows...}
%
To enable developers to better support existing and new privacy policies without onerous manual
labor, we propose \emph{data disguising}.
%
With data disguising, developers specify privacy transformations for database-backed web
applications as high-level, declarative \emph{data disguises}.

A data disguiser sits between application logic and its database. Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows the
architecture of our prototype, \sys, which works for applications using relational databases.
Disguisers automatically translate the provided disguise into the appropriate database transformations, and
applies them starting at a given disguise target (\eg a row in the users table) when invoked.

Data disguising works on top of the object graph encoded by database-backed
applications~\cite{orm}. In the context of relational databases, the nodes of the object graph are
table rows, and the edges of the object graph are foreign key relationships. Data disguises impose
restrictions on the content and structure of this graph. Unsubscription, for example, transforms
this graph to comply with particular constraints of the privacy transformation for account deletion
by modifying table row contents and rewriting foreign key relationships.

Using their application expertise, the developer selects from a menu of possible transformations
(Section~\ref{sec:policies}) that can be performed on objects and object graph edges.
The data disguise consists of the chosen set of transformations, and determines the
structure of the object graph after a target (\eg the unsubscribing user) is disguised.

Disguising a target object creates \emph{guises}---transformed versions and/or copies of the target.
Disguising requires object deletion and anonymization: guises help maintain referential integrity
when data is deleted, and transform objects into anonymized forms.  Guises additionally decorrelate
other objects from the target: for example, a new guise for the user can be created in the users
table, and the foreign key relationship from a row in the posts table rewritten to point this guise,
to decorrelate the post from the user.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Specifying Data Disguises}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:policies}

Data disguises consist of a set of chosen transformations on objects and edges in the application
object graph.
These transformations are applied starting from the developer-specified target object, \eg an
unsubscribing or inactive user.
%The developer chooses one transformation for each object type, and
%one for each edge type.
Object type transformations specify how to transform a template object into \emph{guises}.  Edge types
transformations specify whether edges should be deleted, retained, or decorrelated and replaced with
edges to guises.

We next describe a menu of object and edge transformations sufficient to write disguises for the
privacy transformations in Section~\ref{sec:survey}.

    \caption{Creating two guises of an example user (of a synthetic application schema).}
    \label{fig:guises}
\end{figure*}

Creating guises requires developers to specify how to transform attributes of the template
object for each guise.
%
Objects have three kinds of attributes: a unique identifier attribute; value
(non-referential) attributes such as timestamps or usernames; and edge (\eg foreign key)
attributes that identify correlations with other objects.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:guises} shows how guises are produced for users. User objects have \texttt{id} as
the identifier attribute,
\texttt{tag\_id} as an edge attribute (a foreign key constraint to tag objects),
and all other attributes as value attributes.

Guises always have unique, random identifier attributes.
Developers choose how to create guise edge and value attributes, selecting from the following:

\paragraph{(1) Copy object content.} Guises of the same template object all share the template's
    attribute value. If the attribute is an edge attribute (\eg is a foreign key column),
    all guises will share an edge to the same object.

    Copying allows developers to retain the template's content and not have to
    consider how to generate new attribute values for guises. However,
    this should only be chosen if guise attribute values cannot be generated, or if this
    attribute says little about the true identity of the entity.

    For example, Figure~\ref{fig:guises} shows how the \texttt{darkmode} attribute is copied in
    all ghosts; the \texttt{darkmode} attribute reveals very little about the underlying user's
    identity.

\paragraph{(2) Generate new content.}
        For value attributes, developers specify whether the guise's value should be random,
        a default value, or generated from the template value via a custom function (\eg a hash of
        the template value, or the encrypted template value). Figure~\ref{fig:guises} illustrates
        an example of random (\texttt{username}) and default (\texttt{active}) generated value attributes.

        To create new guise edge attributes (\eg new foreign key relationships), the data disguise
        recursively generates a guise for the connected object, and rewrites the edge to the new
        guise.  Figure~\ref{fig:guises} shows how creating two user guises recursively creates two
        tag guises, and uses the tag guises' identifiers as foreign key constraints.

\paragraph{(3) Copy object content, but only once.} One guise copies the attribute value from the
template object, but all other guises generate new values (as described above).  \texttt{notifs} in
Figure~\ref{fig:guises} illustrates how the attribute is copied once. This policy enables the
application to retain the original object content (\eg a count of how many users want
notifications), without \eg creating duplicates.

\subsection{Transforming Edges Between Objects}
\label{design:edgepol}

Edge transformations specify how guises restructure the object graph.
The data disguiser applies these edge transformations while
recursively traversing edges from the target.  For clarity, we refer to edges as between a
\emph{parent} object and a \emph{child} object, where the child references the parent
(\eg via a foreign key column in a relational database).
%
The developer specifies transformations for each edge type, choosing from the following:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Retain} edges of this type. Transform both parent and child objects into a single guise
        each.
    \item \textbf{Decorrelate} edges of this type. Create a new guise from the parent for each of
        the parent's children; replace each child's edge to the parent with an edge to one of the
        parent's guises.
    \item \textbf{Delete} edges of this type. Transform the parent object into a single guise;
        remove the child and its descendants.
\end{enumerate}

Application of edge transformations must also consider whether transformations depend on the edge
directionality (to \eg prevent accidental disguising of other users' profiles through shared objects);
and whether these transformations should be conditional (\eg remove tags from a user's papers only
if the tags were created by the unsubscribing user) or partially applied (\eg remove tags from a
user's papers only until the papers make up fewer than $10$\% of all tagged papers).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse
%By default, all \emph{sensitive} entities---entities transitively connected via
%parent-child edges to the mask's target entity---transform into with ghost entities.
%For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:edgepol}a, all reviews and papers of the unsubscribing user are by
%default replaced by ghosts.

%Any parent of a sensitive child is ghosted as well. This is not actually true; we retain the
%original parent entity, but allow it to be decorrelated
%\lyt{Child-to-Parent edges can have different ghost
%generation policies + edge policies than Parent-to-Child edges. I'm not sure if we should mention
%that here (seems too detailed?)}

\paragraph{Child-Parent Edge Transformations.}
Data masks also allow the developer to specify edge transformations in the child-parent direction,
namely from sensitive children to parents that are not descendants of the user.
%
For example, papers have both tags and users as parents. If an unsubscribed user authors all papers
with a particular tag, the developer may realize that the tag can reidentify the user, and want to
decorrelate the paper from the tag.

Because parents of sensitive children may have non-sensitive children (\eg many papers may share
tags with the user's papers), decorrelation and delete transformations in the child-parent direction
take a \textbf{sensitivity threshold} as an argument, which tells the mask how many edges need to be
decorrelated or deleted.

In the paper-tag example, a reasonable sensitivity threshold
might be $0.1$: fewer than 10\% of all papers with a specific tag key should be correlated with an
(unsubscribed) user.  Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivity} shows an example in which paper-tag edges are
decorrelated to meet a threshold of 0.5.

\paragraph{Edge Transformation Filters}
For decorrelation or delete transformations (in either parent-child or child-parent directions), the
developer can additionally specify an \textbf{edge filter}. The filter takes the parent and child
entities of the edge as inputs, and returns whether the entities satisfy the filter. If yes, the
edge is decorrelated or deleted; otherwise, the edge is retained.
%
For example, perhaps we want to remove tags from a user's papers (decorrelate paper-tag edges)
\emph{only if} the tags were created by the unsubscribing user.
\fi

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse
\sys also handles user data management and storage.
While unsubscribing a user, \sys tracks all deletions and modifications to the database.
\sys encrypts this log with a per-user key, and stores this encrypted
blob in a dedicated application datastore (Figure~\ref{fig:arch}, step 5). The user key is secret-shared using a (2, 3)
threshold scheme~\cite{secretsharing} between the user, \sys, and a trusted third party (\eg
Amazon S3), so that the user can authorize \sys and the third party to restore the key if
the user forgets their share.
%Alternatively, the key can also be password-encrypted, which relies
%on the user not forgetting their password.
The user can optionally choose to store this encrypted data themselves
%(or in a third party cloud provider),
and be in charge of providing their data and key to \sys to decrypt the data upon
resubscription.

To resubscribe, a user authorizes the decryption of their data and associated metadata by
providing their share of the key (or authorizing a trusted third party to reconstruct the secret
with the application). \sys decrypts the data with the key, and systematically reverses
the modifications made during unsubscription, restoring removed entities and correlations between
entities.

\subsection{\sys's Execution Algorithm}
\begin{figure*}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/algo}

    \caption{Stages of \sys's execution when unsubscribing user U1. Entities and edges detected as
    sensitive are outlined in red. Only the part of the entity graph relevant to unsubscription is shown.
    For simplicity, the specified guises policies apply for all attributes
    of the entity: a black ghost entity indicates that it is a full clone of the original.
    New edges indicates that the edge (foreign-key) value of the child has been changed to
    point to the specified parent.\\
    In this example, \sys decorrelates paper-tag edges only enough that the proportion of sensitive papers
    is at most the sensitivity threshold of 0.5, retaining one correlation between a sensitive
    paper P2 and the parent tag T1, and decorrelating the other sensitive paper P1 from the tag.}
    \label{fig:algo}
\end{figure*}


Given an application's schema and unsubscription policy, and an entity to be decorrelated as input,
\sys executes unsubscription as follows. Figure~\ref{fig:algo} illustrates each step.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parent-Child Traversal:} \sys traverses the entity graph starting from the input entity,
        going down parent to child edges (and halting if it detects a cycle).
        \sys collects traversed edges as it traverses the graph.

    \item \textbf{Parent-Child Edge Policy Application:}
        Post-traversal, \sys acts on each collected edge instance according to the specified
        decorrelation relationship policy for that edge's type.

        \sys takes all edges of every unique parent entity, and applies policies as appropriate.
        Note that any sensitivity threshold less than $1$ requires that \emph{all} edges be decorrelated or
        deleted, depending on the developer's specified choice: all the children of this parent are
        sensitive due to the nature of \sys's parent-child traversal.

        Any edges that should be deleted removes the child entity and any descendants.
        \sys generates new ghost parents using the real parent as template for any edges that should
        be decorrelated, and rewrites the child's edge attribute to be the ghost parent's
        identifier. If any edges are retained, \sys generates a ghost parent entity to replace the
        parent.

    \item \textbf{Child-Parent Edge Policy Application:}
        Next, \sys takes the children of all traversed edge instances, and considers the set of
        edges from these children to other parents \emph{not} traversed by \sys during the first
        traversal phase. In other words, these children have multiple parents, at least one of which
        is transitively connected to the input entity.

        Intuitively, children of edges traversed by \sys share a connection with the initial
        entity being decorrelated. Edges \emph{from} these children to other parent entities may
        thus leak sensitive identifying information.

        \sys acts on these child-parent edges according to the specified edge policy for each edge's
        type. For each unique parent, \sys limits the proportion of edges of each type that connect
        to sensitive entities (the children of traversed edge instances) to below the policy's
        sensitivity threshold by either decorrelating or deleting the children.
        If \sys retains any edges from sensitive children to the real parent, then \sys generates a
        ghost parent entity to replace the parent.

        Note that unlike the previous steps, this step considers edges from parents that may have
        many non-sensitive children (\eg a particular tag may correlate with many stories by various
        authors).  \sys therefore may retain edges to sensitive children when given a sensitivity
        threshold less than 1 and greater than 0, unlike in the previous step.

        \sys optionally allows developers to specify that edges have weaker or stronger edge
        policies in the child-to-parent direction than in the  parent-to-child direction. Weaker
        policies---higher sensitivity thresholds---allow \sys to retain links if \emph{only the
        child} is sensitive, but decorrelate or remove the link if \emph{both} the child and parent
        are sensitive. For example, perhaps a user wants to ensure that they are decorrelated from
        their reviews, but correlations between the review and the the paper authors can still be
        retained.

        Stronger policies may specify that the parent connected to sensitive children should
        decorrelate \emph{all} correlations to the paper even from non-sensitive correlations.
        Developers specify such a policy with a sensitive threshold of -1. For
        example, perhaps the set of users with review conflicts to the paper can identify the
        author, even if the author is decorrelated from the paper. We see an example of this in
        Section~\ref{sec:hotcrp_example} (Figure~\ref{fig:pcs}).

    \item \textbf{Anonymizing Leaf Children:}
        If any sensitive children that are leaves (have no children) remain, \sys generates a ghost child entity to replace this leaf.

        In Figure~\ref{fig:algo}, step 4, P1 and P2 are both leaves. \sys generates ghosts for both
        these papers: since these papers have \texttt{CloneOne} guises policies, ghost papers gP1
        and gP2 are identical to P1 and P2, and retain the edge attributes linking them to their
        respective parent tags and users.

    \item \textbf{Returning User Data:} \sys collects all removed entities that have either been
        replaced by ghost entities, or deleted entirely from the graph. \sys also records all
        generated ghost entity identifiers, and which ghost entities replaced which real entity.
        \sys returns both the removed entity data and this ghost entity metadata to the user.
\end{enumerate}

Note that \sys must decide \emph{which} ghost clones the template entity's attributes when the
developer selects a \texttt{CloneOne} guises policy for one or more attributes. \sys always
associates the cloned ghost with as many non-sensitive entities as possible. For example, as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:algo} step 3b, if \sys decorrelates sensitive papers from a parent tag with a
\texttt{CloneOne} policy, \sys chooses the ghost tag that remains associated with non-sensitive
papers to be the clone. This decision ensures that any unsensitive application
data remain as unaffected as possible when disguising another entity.
To optimize
\texttt{CloneOne} policies, \sys can simply retain the original template entity instead of producing
a cloned ghost.
%\sys provides a menu of unsubscription policy choices that allow developers to choose how to
%\emph{ghost} individual data record content, and how to \emph{decorrelate} sensitive correlations.
%Specifying the policy requires nothing more than the application schema: guises policies act on
%application datatables and on foreign key relationships between tables.
%Table column values can be ghosted---removed, anonymized, or modified---in application-specific
%ways; and correlations can be broken, removed, or desensitized by adding noise. This gives
%developers the flexibility to specify fine-grained policies that properly de-identify a user, while
%retaining data as necessary for the application.

%\sys must pinpoint exactly which data and correlations may be
%identity-sensitive, and allow developers to specify exactly what the post-unsubscription state of
%this data should be.
